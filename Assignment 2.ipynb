    "A sender wants to send a message securely over an unreliable communication channel to a receiver. To do this, we use **RSA**, a widely used encryption method.  \n",

    "   - $gcd(e, φ(n)) = 1$ (i.e., no common factors except 1).  \n",

    "4. **Public key:** $(e, n)$ known to both sender and receiver. The public key is shared openly so anyone (including sender) can use it to encrypt a message.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Sender encrypts message:**  \n",
    "   If the original message is $M$, then $C = (M^e) \\% n$, where `%` means the modulo operator in Python. The result $C$ is called the ciphertext — it looks like random numbers, and is what gets transmitted securely.  \n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Receiver computes the secret key $d$**, which satisfies $(d \\times e) \\% φ(n) = 1$. The private key (sometimes called the secret key) is kept hidden and is used by the receiver to decrypt messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Receiver decrypts message:**  $M = (C^d) \\% n$. The result is the decrypted message, which should be identical to the original M.\n",
